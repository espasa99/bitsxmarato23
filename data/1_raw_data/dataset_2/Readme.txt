DESCRIPTION
-----------

1. Dataset language:
English


2. Abstract:
Data set obtained as a result of the sequencing by ONT MinION platform and subsequent taxonomic classification of the 16S rRNA gene of seminal microbiota from idiopathic infertile men and donors. The results are shown in terms of relative abundance of each bactera identified for each individual and are grouped into spreadsheets by taxonomic level (phylum, family, and genera).

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

1. Description of methods used for collection-generation of data: 
Collection: Seminal samples were collected by masturbation after a procedure to avoid bacterial contamination, which consist on urinating, washing hands and penis and ejaculation in sterile recipient.
Microbiome analysis: Microbiota DNA extraction was performed with ZymoBIOMICS DNA Microprep. Full-lenght 16S rRNA gene were sequenced after amplification by PCR with 27F and 1494R universal primers. DNA library preparation was performed using PCR Barcoding kit according Four-primer PCR (SQK-PBK004) workflow (Nanopore protocol, 2017). DNA sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION system.


2. Methods for processing the data: 
Sequencing data was processed with FastQC Toolkit to read quality filtering (<150pb, >30 q-phred score, de novo chimeric reads elimination).
Taxonomic classification of bacterial reads was performed by 16S Workflow from EPI2ME software platform.


3. Instrument- or software- specific information needed to interpret the data:
Spreadsheet software compatible with .xlsx extension (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice...)


4. Instruments, calibration and standards information:
N/A


5. Environmental or experimental conditions:
Cellular biology lab conditions. Sterile conditions for microbiome analysis.
Computational environment: MacOS and EPI2ME software platform (cloud system)


6. Quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:
N/A
