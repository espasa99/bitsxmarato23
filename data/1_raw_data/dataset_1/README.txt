DESCRIPTION
-----------

1. Dataset language:
English


2. Abstract:
Data set obtained as a result of the sequencing by Illumina platform and subsequent taxonomic classification of the 16S rRNA gene of seminal microbiota from idiopathic infertile men and donors. The results are shown in terms of relative abundance of each bactera identified for each individual and are grouped into spreadsheets by taxonomic level (phylum, family, and genera). Each individual also presents metadata regarding information about their lifestyle, intake habits, clinical history, and analysis of their sperm quality parameters (seminogram, oxidative stress and sperm DNA integrity).

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------
1. Description of methods used for collection-generation of data: 
Collection: Seminal samples were collected by masturbation after a procedure to avoid bacterial contamination, which consist on urinating, washing hands and penis and ejaculation in sterile recipient.
Seminogram: Sperm quality test was performed according to WHO laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen 5th edition 2010.
Oxidative stress: Seminal oxidative stress was assessed by oxidation-reduction potential measurement using the MiOXSYS system.
Sperm DNA integrity: Sperm DNA fragmentation was assessed by TUNEL, alkaline Comet and neutral Comet assays, and sperm chromatin protamination status was assessed by Chromomycin A3 test, as previously described in Garcia-Segura, 2020 (doi: 10.3390/biology9090262)
Microbiome analysis: Microbiota DNA extraction was performed with ZymoBIOMICS DNA Microprep. Full-lenght 16S rRNA gene were sequenced after amplification by PCR with 27F and 1494R universal primers. DNA library preparation was performed using NGSgo kit according GENDX NGSgo workflow (2017, 4th edition). DNA sequencing was performed using Illumina MiSeq system.


2. Methods for processing the data: 
Sequencing data was processed with FastQC Toolkit to read quality filtering (<150pb, >30 q-phred score, de novo chimeric reads elimination).
Taxonomic classification of bacterial reads was performed by Dragen Metagenomics.


3. Instrument- or software- specific information needed to interpret the data:
Spreadsheet software compatible with .xlsx extension (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice...)


4. Instruments, calibration and standards information:
--


5. Environmental or experimental conditions:
Cellular biology lab conditions. Sterile conditions for microbiome analysis.
Computational environment: MacOS and Illumina BaseSpace (cloud platform)


6. Quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:
